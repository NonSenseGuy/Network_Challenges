                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Instagram began development in San Francisco as Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.[15] Realizing that Burbn was too similar to Foursquare, 
                        Systrom and Krieger refocused their app on photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among Burbn users.[16] They renamed the app Instagram, a portmanteau of instant camera and telegram.[17]</p>
                    <h6>2010: Beginnings</h6>
                    <p>
                        On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[18] Josh Riedel joined the company in October as Community Manager,[19] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[19] and Jessica Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in August 2011.[19][20]
                        
                        The first Instagram post was a photo of South Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger on July 16, 2010.[21][22]
                        
                        Systrom shared his first post, a picture of a dog and his girlfriend's foot, a few hours later (at 9:24 PM). It has been wrongly attributed as the first Instagram photo due to the earlier letter of the alphabet in its URL.[23][24][better source needed]
                        
                        On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store.[25]</p>

                    <h6>2011: Major funding</h6>
                    <p><
                        In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million in Series A funding from a variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.[26] The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million.[27] In April 2012, Instagram raised $50 million from venture capitalists with a $500 million valuation.[28] Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money after the sale to Facebook.[29]
                        2012: Android release, Facebook acquisition and web launch
                        
                        On April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version of its app for Android phones,[30][31] and it was downloaded more than one million times in less than one day.[32]
                        
                        On April 9, 2012, Facebook, Inc. bought Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock,[33][34][35] with a plan to keep the company independently managed.[36][37][38] Britain's Office of Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 2012,[39] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, allowing the deal to proceed.[40] On September 6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook officially closed with a purchase price of $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.[41][42]
                        
                        The deal closed just before Facebook's scheduled initial public offering according to CNN. [38] The deal price was compared to the $35 million Yahoo! paid for Flickr in 2005.[38] Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook was "committed to building and growing Instagram independently." [38] According to Wired, the deal netted Systrom $400 million.[43]
                        
                        In November 2012, Instagram launched website profiles, allowing anyone to see user feeds from a web browser with limited functionality</p> 
                    <h6>2014: Android update and Facebook Places</h6>
                    <p> The Android app has received two significant updates: first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of the app by half and added performance improvements;[45][46] then in April 2017, to add an offline mode that allows users to view and interact with content without an Internet connection. At the time of the announcement, it was reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users are located outside the U.S., and while the aforementioned functionality was live at its announcement, Instagram also announced its intention to make more features available offline, and that they were "exploring an iOS version".[47][48][49]

                        Since the app's launch it had used the Foursquare API technology to provide named location tagging. In March 2014, Instagram started to test and switch the technology to use Facebook Places.[50][51]
                        </p>
                    <h6>2015: Desktop redesign</h6>
                    <p> In June 2015, the desktop website user interface was redesigned to become more flat and minimalistic, but with more screen space for each photo and to resemble the layout of Instagram's mobile website.[52][53][54] Furthermore, one row of pictures only has three instead of five photos to match the mobile layout. The slideshow banner[55][56] on the top of profile pages, which simultaneously slide-showed seven picture tiles of pictures posted by the user, alternating at different times in a random order, has been removed. In addition, the formerly angular profile pictures became circular.</p>
                    <h6>2016: Interface redesign and Windows app</h6>
                    <p>On May 11, 2016, Instagram revamped its design, adding a black-and-white flat design theme for the app's user interface, and a less skeuomorphistic, more abstract, "modern" and colorful icon.[57][58][59] Rumors of a redesign first started circulating in April, when The Verge received a screenshot from a tipster, but at the time, an Instagram spokesperson simply told the publication that it was only a concept.[60]

                        On December 6, 2016, Instagram introduced comment liking. However, unlike post likes, the user who posted a comment does not receive notifications about comment likes in their notification inbox. Uploaders can optionally decide to deactivate comments onto a post.[61][62][63]
                        
                        In April 2016, Instagram released a Windows 10 Mobile app, after years of demand from Microsoft and the public to release an app for the platform.[64][65] The platform previously had a beta version of Instagram, first released on November 21, 2013 and also compatible with Windows Phone 8.[66][67][68] The new app added support for videos (viewing and creating posts or stories, and viewing live streams), album posts and direct messages.[69] Similarly, an app for Windows 10 personal computers and tablets was released in October 2016.[70][71] In May, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a "lightweight" version of the Explore tab.[72][73]
                        
                        On April 30, 2019, the Windows 10 Mobile app was discontinued, though the mobile website remains available as a progressive web application with limited functionality. The app also remains available on Windows 10 computers and tablets.</p>
                    <h6>2018: Management changes</h6>
                    <p>On September 24, 2018, Krieger and Systrom announced in a statement they would be stepping down from Instagram.[74][75] On October 1, 2018, it was announced that Adam Mosseri would be the new head of Instagram.[76][77]
                        2019: Feature changes, Reels
                        
                        During Facebook F8, it was announced that Instagram would, beginning in Canada, pilot the removal of publicly-displayed "like" counts for content posted by other users.[78] Like counts would only be visible to the user who originally posted the content. Mosseri stated that this was intended to have users "worry a little bit less about how many likes they're getting on Instagram and spend a bit more time connecting with the people that they care about."[79][80] It has been argued that low numbers of likes in relativity to others could contribute to a lower self-esteem in users.[80][78] The pilot began in May 2019, and was extended to 6 other markets in July.[80][81] The pilot was expanded worldwide in November 2019.[82] Also in July 2019, Instagram announced that it would implement new features designed to reduce harassment and negative comments on the service.[83]
                        
                        In August 2019, Instagram also began to pilot the removal of the "Following" tab from the app, which had allowed users to view a feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow. The change was made official in October, with head of product Vishal Shah stating that the feature was underused, and that some users were "surprised" when they realized their activity was being surfaced in this manner.[84][85]
                        
                        In November 2019, it was reported that Instagram had begun to pilot a new video feature known as "Reels". It is similar in functionality to the Chinese video sharing service TikTok, with a focus on allowing users to record short videos set to pre-existing sound clips from other posts.</p>
